@archeage im having problems	 maine	 usa!

@archeage i have a bad feeling about this regarding joining any server after official launch :/					
@archeage are you ready for the queue ? the biggest challenge in archeage !!!					
@archeage i cant get authentication emails so no	 not ready.				
@dusty_monk hah! ive slowed down in ffxiv. i think im going to play some archeage in between real -- board -- games and some development:)

@archeage there will be a lot of upset people tomorrow lol					
thinking that waiting 2 and a half hours after launch to play #archeage because of work is going to suck something fierce :(					
@archeage more server(power) tomorrow confirmed? :d					
@jontronshow if you want impromptu adventures	 so far archeage has been fairly promising. planning on starting a pirate crew myself.

@doombrah @archeage i had the game originally	 but trion support couldnt figure out my issue	 so they refunded my money and took founder :(			
a 3 minute grace period on disconnects would be fantastic @archeage.waiting an hour in queue only to have my power flicker was anticlimactic					
@zionspartan go play archeage for new pvp xp					
@archeage are you ready for the influx of new players and the stress as even more founders are in queues. wish i didnt have to work :-(

@archeage im having login failed issues and was wondering if anyone can help me with that.					
@archeage just got kicked out of the game and i cant get back in anymore because it keeps kicking me right after th cs.					
@archeage @scapes been a terrible head start period	 i sure hope you have some tricks left because this isnt a $50 value experience				
@archeage im trying hard to justify the money i spent for this game so that i can tell people about it	 but this is becoming ridiculous				
@archeage would love to play but yall keep getting "ddos" #archeage you will have fun if you can get in.					
@archeage @scapes now we have crash to desktop every time. gawd trion really.					
bloody @archeage just broke on me 4 times in a row for skipping their shitty cutscene					
@archeage just got kicked out of the game and i cant back in anymore because it kicks me before i even get to the servers list.

@archeage @massively sarcasim	 but thanks for the awesome screen shot so i can see what i am missing being as though the servers are borked				
@archeage @massively ntomorrow is going to be a mess. should have spent ore time working out the server load issues.					
@archeage i paid $50 that i shouldnt have spent for your 4day headstart. all i get is constant server crashing just to wait in que 45m					
@archeage i dont feel like i will ever be able to spend money on this company again and trust its going to a good place. im sorry :(					
@archeage i am not sure if your servers are ready to begin the journey :(					
@ozotiku @archeage i dunno	 logging in is pretty challenging too.

@archeage you do after all realize that we paid money to play this game "as released"					
@archeage and so will you give us a refund or extra time to compensate us for not being able to login?					
since #archeage has been released	 im looking into starting a new thread about client tweaks thread soon.				
rt @bumbusjones: @archeage you do after all realize that we paid money to play this game "as released"					
@archeage yep	 but did lack of stress test in the beta launch				
@archeage why dont you work on your pre-launch on a less populated time for the game... your screwing over people who paid money!					
@archeage guessing there are login issues? my character is missing when i select my server.					
@archeage let us know when this game is back online					
@archeage you know what fuck it	 i didnt even want to play archeage today >.< #sad				
@archeage in it till the founders time ends (min.) but these issues on just headstart have made me depressed. glad i didnt take work off :(					
@skyler093 hey there! have you tried all the troubleshooting steps available here? http://t.co/y2lgywomou					
@archeage paying 50$ and i cant play :/					
@wowthatsawful hey there	 that can be resolved by logging out and logging back in.				
@k0z @archeage go back to select server then reconnect. should show your toon	 happens to me every now and then.				
@archeage i loved cb and ob but since paying for the 4 day head-start i have hated this game....thanks guys. i know you try but its ruined					
@archeage oh yea. it eventually works. i attribute it to the mass amounts of people. funny is the queue time after .5hrs it froze @ 5 min					
@archeage got on the server	 character missing despite the server list saying i have characters on the server. restarted didnt help.				
we did get some good questing in tonight though! fun times ^.^ http://t.co/jgyn0xpxcq

@pahimar why wow? archeage is going great live today.					
@archeage im just here to watch the world burn. ggs on not allowing a pre-download of an 8.5 gb client. you thought head start was bad? lol

@archeage @riblet8 you mean you not enjoying the game of archequeue ?!? play the way its meant to be play: q time = your game time. fun !					
more time for that archeage grind	 so it works out				
@pavelvm77 @archeage i couldnt even get into the queue last night said to try other server 2char on kyrios					
@syzenna_ thats cool. also	 if you feel like it	 you could have a look at #archeage as it releases today. queues may happen but cat-people!			
@archeage at what european hour is it going to release ?? cant wait!!!!					
@archeage where and when can i purchase status patron if i dont have a founder pack? so excited by #archeage launch!!					
@archeage are you guys aware of a bug thats making our machines restart or bsod randomly	i see the forums are littered with people posting

@bissahellman @archeage thought the same when i did not find mine. i really think some of my items were not delivered					
soooo... i cant even update @archeage today in preparation for tomorrow? http://t.co/qorzeubovf					
too bad the land that people have after they abandone a server doesnt instantly forfeit when they leave #archeage					
 more day for @archeage #archeage !! super excited					
@archeage so are all us servers also all in ques of like 2000+ or is that just us eu people					
@archeage @scapes when i try to select another server than the one i come from its greyed out connect ? i have 6 unlocks..					
@archeage i am so scared of tomorrows launch the 4 servers for the whole of eu except russia					
@archeage any way to transfer our characters to the new server or we have to start from scratch?					
#archeage announced 2 new servers	  for na and  for eu. only on the website. no one knew.				
well	 doesnt look like ill be playing archeage after all. still in early access.				
gaming company trion worlds hit with another series of ongoing ddos attacks this weekend. http://t.co/rdegpth6wd via @gamesonnet					
@archeage i exited to char select	 my chars were gone	 went back to server select and it worked again but now im in a 3hr queue			
@archeage i really wish the labor system was a little different	 holds hardcore players back a lot. not to mention its account wide.				
#archeage just announced 2 new servers have opened! hopefully all the land wont be gone by tomorrow. 	-)				
the newest #archeage servers are: inoch and aier. roll there tomorrow if you want a chance at land and less queues! :-)					
do i want to play archeage? yes. do i want to spend the money on it? no.					
two new servers coming up for archeage. inoch for na and aier for eu. #archeage					
archeage hype					
rt @nymira_g3: new servers opening up for @archeage in about 0 minutes! http://t.co/ux64zwz5er

@strawlie dragon age and then archeage tomorrow hehehe					
@therevtastic i installed archeage to prepare and it slowed my whole computer down so much d: i uninstalled and it was fine again >.<					
why make me wait 45 mins in a queue to get online then just show me a black screen when i enter. so i have to exit & queue again #archeage					
@archeage will you ever fix the authentication code thing?? i want to buy your game and you wont let me. ffs					
@archeage yay.. now tell us about that compensation.					
@archeage finally					
@archeage its a start...but one server per region isnt enough.					
@archeage fix your authentication code now					
gah	 wow	 destiny	 madden	 archeage. taking the day off for gaming tomorrow. going all in on destiny/archeage methinks.	
@archeage so... how long is the "seperate" queue for banned accounts exactly? or do those emails land in the trashcan directly?					
archeage tomorrow	 mhm				
@archeage now jus another server that crammed to the max					
@archeage how can we enjoy this game?? come on..dont epic fail					
 more day until i lose myself in archeage					
well i was going to give archeage a go when it comes out tomorrow but its been removed from steam and im not playing silly buggers					
@kokauh97 @archeage @temeezer and for our missing items ? i dont know... maybe we can have... something like what we paid for ?					
@archeage if only i had a headstart. going to replace minecraft with archeage! 😊					
@archeage still with queues of over 2000 to play	 seriously folks dont even bother with this tripe for at least a month.				
@archeage no french / german / spanish serv incoming ?					
#archeage launch tomorrow! :d can’t wait! :d					
@archeage if i had not already made my character i would change to the new one					
ooooooo @archeage ! not sure your announcement of two new servers is going to go down well! but hopefully itll ease populations					
think my new favorite time killer while i wait on videos to render is camping the archeage auction house. :3					
only 24 hours til @archeage will be flooded with new players again. #hype					
@archeage cant get past the queue to buy a new char slot and get into the new server. screwed again. gg trion	 thanks for the warning.				
@hartsman @archeage why can i not login to the new server!!!!! i only have 2 characters total on  server! wtf???					
@archeage what good is a new server if i cant connect to it? i have only 2 chars total on one server...					
archeage is brilliant but this is beginning to get annoying now.. http://t.co/czvchlyrb

@massively @archeage queue warrior					
archeage is giving me way too many problems.					
@archeage a bit late for those already on the others	 with land etc. you couldnt make it up				
@cdnmojo @archeage small bug	 heres how to get around it - logging in to one of the existing chars first will let you. xl is fixing.				
@archeage appreciate that guys!					
@akseone project cars looks dope. i have elite dangerous instead of sc. archeage (mmo) launches 2morrow (yt the trailer). ds+fifa this month

@donryikko @kokauh97 @archeage @temeezer try putting in a ticket? i got a response within an hour and they fixed the issue.					
archeage relases tomorrow?!?!?! ahhhhhhh the hyyyppeeeee					
@archeage adding two servers wont fix anything	 im still sat behind 00 people	 i highly doubt that everyone will just move away.			
people are getting all excited over destiny and im just sitting waiting for archeage to be released tomorrow #sko					
@archeage cool. so whats going to be done about us archeum founders that got to play maybe an hour before this? this is not a head start.

watching @kelaisnow play the #archeage pre release makes me really excited to try it out when it goes live tomorrow :o

@archeage :30 to wait in queue for a black screen.... game dont load.... i return in queue for 2hours... thats inacceptable !					
labor points in archeage are a big deal. patron gets 440 a day	 non 288 a day. thats huge! makes me happy for my status as a patron.				
@scapes any fix for archeage not getting past the splash art? after the first two words highlight	 it stops loading				
@archeage instead of only one server make more than one..... still 2000 people queuing on eanna... please.....					
countdown to archeage! http://t.co/huzwhdbjxh					
@archeage it makes absolutely no sense that we need to get caught up in a queue to enter our server when the game disconnects us.

archeage got me hooked woah					
@archeage all the time that you spend in the queue and you paid for patron should be refunded	 as you overload the servers by purpose				
@archeage yeh you need to fix your game abit more instead of worrying about flying boats					
higher larceny gives less of a chance to leave behind footprints wtb more coinpurses please! #archeage

busy at an event tonight. want to play archeage. cant do both! boooooo!					
@thebillmurphy @archeage flawed as any mmo	 but will find success with a dedicated following from a grossly under served niche.				
@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage i havent had enough time to play either but i am enjoying what i have played!					
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage two hours to get in	 and within five minutes	 two of them got bounced back to a 3 hour queue.			
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage #noneformethanks. hope its a good game tho.					
@hartsman @thebillmurphy @archeage game takes waaay too long to load up though. is this a server issue or something with the client?					
@stafunoob i played archeage a little bit in beta	 and i think its definitely worth trying				
@grakulen @thebillmurphy @hartsman @archeage from what i played of beta: meh.					
@archeage hey thanks for new servers	 whoever did that is awesome. :d extremely impressed!!				
@archeage the lag on eanna server is making the game unplayable. combat is a nightmare.					
@itslorgarn browsing around i found your archeage overlay and think it is pretty rad man. awesome stuff.

@archeage promise me you wont let microsoft buy you out. i have already lost one great game cant lose another.
